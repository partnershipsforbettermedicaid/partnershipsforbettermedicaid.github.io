# Partnerships for Improved Medicaid Community-based Care

An abstract paper exploring the feasibility of partnerships between state Medicaid offices and colleges and universities to provide better community-based care to Medicaid recipients and outcomes for the programs themselves.

## My Personal Story

In 1994 I broke my neck in a performance gymnastics routine. As a C5-6 quadriplegic, I require help and equipment for day-to-day activities. Most people meet me in my community where I get aroud in a manual-assist motorized wheelchair. To them I am pretty independent. In the store I need someone to get items off the shelf and put them in my basket and I cannot swipe my card at checkout. When I drop something oftentimes someone has to pick it up for me. At home I can prepare meals and cook a pretty good steak or pork chops. But while I may appear to be pretty independent, every morning someone bathes and dresses me and transfers me into my wheelchair. The routine is flipped around every evening.

My daily care routine is further complicated by many paralysis-related conditions:

* Neurogenic bladder requires a catheter
* Neurogenic bowels require regular bowel routine
* Persistent urinary tract infection
* Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers
* Autonomic dysreflexia causes extreme blood pressure spikes when my body is in pain
* Weight management
* Psychological strain of ensuring each caregiver is providing the acceptible level of care

So, every day my physical condition requires some level of physical assistance from someone: typically between two and 8 hours depending on the ammount of care I need. Over the years I have been blessed with friends and family who have provided each of these services for me and for them I am eternally grateful. But this is not sustainable when I rely on a single family member or friend for my day-to-day care. For this reason I have received community-based care through state Medicaid waiver programs through most of my adulthood.

## Community-based Care, An Alternative to Institutions

Community-based care is provided by most states as an alternative to institutional care for people who can prove they have the natural supports to live in their community. Beneficiaries of these programs have conditions across a broad spectrum of diagnosed conditions. For families without the means to pay for in-home care and many people with disabilities state, federal, county, and city programs are the funding source for their essential daily care. They can live somewhat independently in their homes or apartments instead of a nursing home or other institution.

Community-based care is by most measures a tremendous success. TO-DO: Cite research here.
